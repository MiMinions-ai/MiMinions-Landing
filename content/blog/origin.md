My name is Roland Ding. I am an AI/ML engineer in Canada.

You probably would wonder why would I name this platform MiMinions.

If you are into family movies (like my daughter), you probably would remeber those little yellow creatures from the movie Minions right?

That is how I would like people to feel about the AI agents. Later I may have to change everything due to the copyright issue, but at this point, respect to the universal studio and illuminations studio because, as the creators of these little creatures, they are awesome!
