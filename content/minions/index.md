## Description
In this demo, we created a human like dispatcher who can do the following:
- Receive a request from an employee/truck driver
- Assign a job to the employee/truck driver
- Monitor the schedule and backlog of the employee/truck driver
- Re-assign a job to another employee/truck driver if the current employee/truck driver is not available
- Estimate the job time and idle time/wait time for the employee/truck driver
- Get the weather information for the employee/truck driver from the city where the job is located
