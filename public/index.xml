      <description>My name is Roland Ding. I am an AI/ML engineer in Canada.
You probably would wonder why would I name this platform MiMinions.
If you are into family movies (like my daughter), you probably would remeber those little yellow creatures from the movie Minions right?
That is how I would like people to feel about the AI agents. Later I may have to change everything due to the copyright issue, but at this point, respect to the universal studio and illuminations studio because, they are awesome!</description>
